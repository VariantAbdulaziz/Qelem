# Qelem

This is a RESTful API backed flutter app where students and other users may raise questions they have on different topics and get answers. We believe that this App will be instrumental for the community by giving an easily accessible means for curious minds a pool of knowledge that'll arise by pooling questions individuals might encounter and answers to these questions other members of the Qelem community might think it will address.

## Business Features

- Our System will allow users to post questions they might have on different topics.
- Our System will allow users to give answers for questions they might have knowledge of and get "assist" scores.

Although these business features aren't the only ones our app will have, other business features will rally behind them.

## Authentication/Authorization Feature

- Our system will allow for user registration and login. As our system is backed by an API, most requests will be authenticated. Some endpoints such as the one used for user creation might not need authentication.
- Our system will have different authorization levels for different aspects of the app. A question/answer might be altered or removed by an admin or the author of the question/answer.
